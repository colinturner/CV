## Colin Turner

I’m a full stack developer with a uni degree in materials engineering. Proudly polyglot, I teach myself to read, write, and clean up code in diverse human and computer languages. I offer a technical perspective and flexible ability to pick up new technologies, backed by years of multi-faceted engineering subjects at university, varied technical internships in the materials and mining industries, and a genuine curiosity for the esoteric.

I’m looking for a tech position to grow in: one with complex challenges and space to significantly affect the company’s market products.

## Skills

#### Communication

Whether teaching, learning or collaborating, thorough communication is a constant in my day-to-day work.

When writing a 185-page engineering study for my university final project, I had the opportunity to coordinate a team of 6 group members to produce the final report. Producing a work we could proudly attach our names to required enormous communication and collaboration over a period of several months.


In 2014, I moved to Australia for 8 months to research industrial mineral processing mechanisms in a paid internship at one of the country's top technical universities. My task was to take raw data from materials engineering experiments and then replicate those experiments' real-world results in computational simulations of the same processes. The open-ended scope of my work granted me the opportunity to bring together academics across the scientific spectrum to develop truly unique research.

A year earlier, I had the extraordinary opportunity to gain deep insight into the engineering giant, Rolls-Royce Canada, through a technical internship in Montreal. My task was to produce a 170-page report on the company's annual Research and Development activities. I collaborated with project leaders across the company to develop the report; it was later used to support government research grant applications.

In my summer breaks, I worked as a supervisor at a children's summer camp in Western Canada. There I was tasked with coordinating the daily activities of dozens of staff members. Active and reactive communication helped me to develop best methods to support my team.
#### Adaptability

As I'm addicted to learning, I quickly get bored with repetition. I learned French and German as a child, so I decided to study Spanish when I reached middle school. When that too became routine, I began teaching myself Swedish online. When I met my Norwegian girlfriend, my interest shifted again one language to the west.

When I discovered programming, I found a beautiful intersection of math and language; a forum that merged precision with poetry. I taught myself to proficiency before entering a selective programming bootcamp to accelerate my learning further.

On my technical internship in Australia, I taught myself Ansys Fluent Computational Fluid Dynamics software to model the interactions of simulated air bubbles underwater. When I needed to analyze a video of real-world air bubbles colliding underwater as part of my research, I taught myself advanced picture and video editing to extract the data I wanted.

At children's summer camps in Canada, I became a master of scheduling, event planning and moving hundreds of people from A to B on a daily basis. When I took over this job, I overhauled the procedures left in place by my predecessor and vastly improved the efficiency of the camp's scheduling processes.

In my spare time, I've taught myself audio engineering, sound editing, and piano and guitar to high standards each.

I constantly chase the paths that I'm interested in and learn as much as I can along the way. I don't think I'll ever reach a saturation point in my learning; adaptability means we keep growing.
