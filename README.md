## Colin Turner

I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** passionate about writing clean and test-driven code, currently looking for **a challenging junior developer position.** Proudly polyglot and self-driven, I teach myself the technologies I need, when I need them.

I offer a technical perspective, backed by an engineering degree from Canada's top-ranked university, varied technical internships in the materials and mining industries, and a genuine curiosity for the esoteric.

I’m looking for **a tech position to rapidly grow in**: one with complex challenges, strong mentorship, *a great team*, and space to significantly affect the company’s market products.

## Skills

#### Communication

In teaching, learning and collaborating, I communicate my work thoroughly.

My capstone university project challenged me to produce a front-end loading study for a mineral processing plant. I had the opportunity to coordinate a team of 6 group members to produce the final report. The final 185-page study won top marks for its meticulous research and clarity.

In 2014, I was hired to an 8-month paid internship to research industrial mineral processing at UNSW, one of Australia's top technical universities. My task was to replicate the results of real-world flotation experiments in computational simulations of those same processes. The open-ended scope of my work granted me the opportunity to bring together academics across the scientific spectrum to develop truly unique research. I presented my work to panels at universities in Australia and Canada, and my work has contributed to two PhD projects.

A year earlier, I had the extraordinary opportunity to gain deep insight into the engineering giant, Rolls-Royce, through a technical internship in Montreal. My task was to research and produce a 170-page report on the company's annual Research and Development activities. I collaborated with project leaders across the company to accelerate my knowledge of the company from 0 to 100 in the span of a few months. My report was later used to support government research grant applications.

In my summer breaks, I worked as a supervisor at a children's summer camp in Western Canada. There I was tasked with coordinating the daily activities of dozens of staff members. Active and reactive communication helped me to develop best methods to support my team.
#### Adaptability

I'm a keen autodidact and strive to always keep learning. I picked up French and German as a child, so I decided to study Spanish when I reached middle school. Nowadays I'm focusing on Norwegian.

When I discovered programming, I found a beautiful intersection of maths and language; an arena that merged precision with poetry. I taught myself to programming proficiency before entering a selective bootcamp to continue accelerating my learning.

On my technical internship in Australia, I taught myself CFD software to model the interactions of simulated air bubbles underwater. When I needed to analyse a video of real-world air bubbles colliding underwater as part of my research, I taught myself advanced picture and video editing to extract the data I wanted.

At children's summer camps in Canada, I became a master of scheduling, event planning and moving hundreds of people from A to B on a daily basis. When I took over that job, I overhauled the procedures left in place by my predecessor and vastly improved the efficiency of the camp's scheduling processes.

In my spare time, I've taught myself audio engineering, sound editing, and piano and guitar to high standards each.

I constantly chase the paths that I'm interested in and learn as much as I can along the way. I don't think I'll ever reach a saturation point in my learning; adaptability means we keep growing.
