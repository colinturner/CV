I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** passionate about writing clean and test-driven code, currently looking for **a challenging junior developer position.** Proudly polyglot and self-driven, I teach myself the technologies I need, when I need them.

I offer a technical perspective, backed by an engineering degree from Canada's top-ranked university, varied technical internships in the materials and mining industries, and a genuine curiosity for the esoteric.

I’m looking for **a tech position to rapidly grow in**: one with complex challenges, strong mentorship, *a great team*, and space to significantly affect the company’s market products.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Adaptability

I'm a keen autodidact and strive to always keep learning. I picked up **French** and **German** as a child, so I decided to study **Spanish** when I reached middle school. Nowadays I speak all of them fluently and so I'm focusing on Norwegian. I watch engineering-related documentaries and push myself to continually learn new musical instruments. I don't ever want to be stagnant.

When I discovered programming, I found a beautiful intersection of maths and language; a medium that merged mechanics with poetry. **I taught myself programming to proficiency** before entering Europe's leading web developer bootcamp **to further accelerate my learning**.

On an engineering internship in Australia, **I learned the ins and outs of CFD software** to model the interactions of computer-simulated air bubbles underwater. When I needed to analyse a video of real air bubbles colliding underwater as part of my research, **I taught myself advanced picture and video editing techniques** to extract the data I wanted.

At children's summer camps in Canada, **I became a master of scheduling**, event planning and moving hundreds of people from A to B on a daily basis. When I took over that job, I overhauled the procedures left in place by my predecessor and vastly improved the efficiency of the camp's scheduling processes.

**I constantly chase the paths that I'm interested in and learn as much as I can along the way**. I don't think I'll ever reach a saturation point in my learning; adaptability means we keep growing.

#### Communication

When learning, teaching or collaborating, I communicate my work thoroughly.

My capstone university project challenged me to produce a front-end loading study for a mineral processing plant. This gave me the opportunity to coordinate a team of 6 group members to produce the final report. The final 185-page study won a Faculty of Engineering award for its **meticulous research and clarity**.

As part of my university's co-op program, I was hired for an 8-month paid internship to research industrial mineral processing at UNSW, one of Australia's top technical universities. My task was to replicate real-world flotation experiments in computational simulations. The open-ended scope of my work granted me the opportunity to **learn new technologies** on the fly and develop truly unique research, which **I presented to university panels in Australia and Canada**.

I've also had the extraordinary opportunity to complete a materials engineering internship at Rolls-Royce in Montreal. My task was to research and produce a 170-page report on the company's annual Research and Development activities. **I collaborated with project leaders across the company** to learn all I could about the company in the span of a few months. My report was later used to support government research grant applications.

In my summer breaks, I worked as a supervisor at a children's summer camp in Western Canada. There I was tasked with coordinating the daily activities of dozens of staff members. **Active and reactive communication** helped me to develop best methods **to support my team**.
