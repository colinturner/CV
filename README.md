## Colin Turner

I’m a full stack developer with a uni degree in materials engineering. Proudly polyglot, I teach myself to read, write, and clean up code in diverse human and computer languages. I offer a technical perspective and flexible ability to pick up new technologies, backed by years of multi-faceted engineering subjects at university, varied technical internships in the materials and mining industries, and a genuine curiosity for the esoteric.

I’m looking for a tech position to grow in: one with complex challenges and space to significantly affect the company’s market products.

## Skills

#### Communication

Whether teaching, learning or collaborating, thorough communication is a constant in my day-to-day work.

When writing a 185-page engineering study for my university final project, I had the opportunity to coordinate a team of 6 group members to produce the final report. Producing a work we could proudly attach our names to required enormous communication and collaboration over a period of several months.


In 2014, I moved to Australia for 8 months to research industrial mineral processing mechanisms in a paid internship at one of the country's top technical universities. My task was to take raw data from real-world materials engineering experiments and then replicate those experiments' results in computational simulations. The open-ended scope of my work granted me the opportunity to collaborate with academics across the scientific spectrum to develop truly unique research.

A year earlier, I had the extraordinary opportunity to gain deep insight into the engineering giant, Rolls-Royce Canada, through a technical internship in Montreal. My task was to produce a 170-page report on the company's annual Research and Development activities. I collaborated with project leaders across the company to develop the report; it was later used to support government research grant applications.

In my summer breaks, I worked as a supervisor at a children's summer camp in Western Canada. There I was tasked with coordinating the daily activities of dozens of staff members. Active and reactive communication helped me to develop best methods to support my team.
